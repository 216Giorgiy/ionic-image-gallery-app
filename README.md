It demonstrates how to use [Virtual Scroll](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/components/virtual-scroll/VirtualScroll/) for high performance scrolling of long lists.

It provides an example of how extend the [ViewController](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/components/nav/ViewController/) class to create custom overlays.  It also has a custom transition using Ionic 2's [Animation](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/2.0/src/animations/animation.ts) class.
